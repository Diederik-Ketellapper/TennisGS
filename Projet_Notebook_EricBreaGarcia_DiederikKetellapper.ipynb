The choice we have to make is how we are going to impute then, we could do a couple of different things here: Impute by 0: Most seem to be in female tennis where zero aces are lot more common than in male tennis, it could be that the data was incorrectly recorded as NaN when it was actualy zero. Impute by the mean of aces Impute by the mean of aces but according to sex as we can see clearly here that most have a bias by sex and thus they are definitely not independent by sex."
